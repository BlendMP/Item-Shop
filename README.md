# Item-Shop
What to do, to make item-shop for us.
------------------------------------
Download catalog_config.json from this repo and use fortnite.gg or https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVDgnzNyMCafIWa-dBO3mgNUHmHzgA9O5sWbfQy2Yfg/edit to locate CIDS and IDS of skins & emotes and other cosmetics.



------------------------------------

AthenaCharacter = Skin
AthenaGlider = Glider
AthenaBackpack = backbling
AthenaPickaxe = Pickaxe

Example: AthenaCharacter:CID_001_Athena_Commando_F_Default

Now Prices, ALWAYS edit the prices like in normal Fortnite but put atleast 1 emote for free (Excluding Take The L, scenario, Floss, Head Banger)
Note: The prices is a value that specifies price of the cosmetic in v-bucks.

Send Item-Shops in Item-Shops-ForUs channel and send it as in a .txt or the entire file.

Thank you <3
